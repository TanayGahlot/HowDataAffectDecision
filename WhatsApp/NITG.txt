So lets make the next meeting musical and enjoy the MAGIC of music. If any toastmaster or guest knows to play an instrument, you can bring it along to make the meeting even more MUSICAL.

I invite you all to the next meeting of NIT Goa TM Club which is to be held on Friday, 1st Nov at 2pm. Cheers!

18:19, 15 Jan - Viresh: So you want to know who the two AAP Lok Sabha candidates are? Are you ready for the truth?

The truth is I don't know.

AAP has its own procedure for choosing and fielding candidates. AAP goes to the people and asks them who THEY want as their candidate - so the people get the candidate THEY choose, not one imposed upon them by the party. Then AAP screens this proposed candidate's past, present, reputation, efficiency, morality; asks the public to come up with objections if any [cheating in business, unknown criminal convictions, paternity suits, whatever]; if any of these are proved, this AAP candidate is made to withdraw even at the very last minute [like one was in Delhi].

And only once he or she undergoes and passes this tough scanning is the candidate approved, finalised, and made to stand for elections.

Interesting, no? In a country which is so used to having proven criminals, who pay their party leaders a few crores for the 'ticket', thrust upon it?

I mean... can you imagine a Party which sells its own tickets to its own candidates? If the party itself is so corrupt within itself, if the party is for sale to itself, in what manner do you think it then rules you and me?!

13:28, 4 Feb - Prabhav: Now this is very interesting & MUST READ ...My car's manual says to roll down the windows to let out all the hot air before turning on the A/C. WHY ?

No wonder more folks are dying from cancer than ever before. We wonder where this stuff comes from, but here is an example that
explains a lot of the cancer-causing incidents.

Many people are in their cars the first thing in the morning, and the last thing at night, 7 days a week.

Please do NOT turn on A/C as soon as you enter the car.

Open the windows after you enter your car and then after a couple of minutes, turn ON the AC .

Here's why: According to research, the car's dashboard, seats, a/c ducts, in fact ALL of the plastic objects in your vehicle, emit Benzene,
a Cancer causing toxin. A BIG CARCINOGEN. Take the time to observe the smell of heated plastic in your car when you open it,
and BEFORE you start it up.

In addition to causing cancer, Benzene poisons your bones, causes anaemia and reduces white blood cells. Prolonged exposure can
cause Leukemia and increases the risk of some cancers. It can also cause miscarriages in pregnant women.

The "acceptable" Benzene level indoors is: 50mg per sq.ft.

A car parked indoors, with windows closed, will contain 400-800 mg of Benzene - 8 times the acceptable level.


If parked outdoors in the sun, at a temperature above 60 degrees F, the Benzene level goes up to 2000-4000 mg, 40 times the acceptable level.

People who get into the car, keeping the windows closed, will eventually INHALE excessive amounts of the BENZENE toxin.

Benzene is a toxin that affects your kidneys and liver. What's worse, it is extremely difficult for your body to expel this toxic stuff.

So friends, please open the windows and doors of your car - give it some time for the interior to air out 
-(dispel the deadly stuff) - before you enter the vehicle.

Thought: 'When someone shares something of value with you and you benefit from it, you have a moral obligation to share it with others.'
